    3. Application domains or datasets
    4. Novel contributions or focus
    5. Any notable differences in experimental approach or scope

    Paper 1:
    Title: {paper1['title']}
    Abstract: {paper1['abstract']}

    Paper 2:
    Title: {paper2['title']}
    Abstract: {paper2['abstract']}

- Tags key results, population, intervention, outcome (for clinical/biomedical fields)

Why it’s powerful:
- Unlocks much deeper semantic understanding—ideal for building structured knowledge graphs. 


---

#### 4. AI-Powered Research Feed / Discovery Engine

Platforms: ResearchRabbit, Connected Papers
