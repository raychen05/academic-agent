    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders globally and leads to an excessive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the brain. Circulating cell-free DNA (ccf-DNA) are double-stranded DNA fragments of different sizes and origins that are released into the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) due to cell death (i.e., necrosis and apoptosis) or are actively released by viable cells via exocytosis and NETosis. Using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR), we comprehensively analyzed and distinguished circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA (ccf mtDNA) and circulating cell-free nuclear DNA (ccfDNA) in the serum and CSF of PD and control patients. The quantitative analysis of serum ccf-DNA in PD patients demonstrated a significant increase in ccf mtDNA and ccfDNA compared to that in healthy control patients and a significantly higher copy of ccf mtDNA when compared to ccfDNA. Next, the serum ccf mtDNA levels significantly increased in male PD patients compared to those in healthy male controls. Furthermore, CSF ccf mtDNA in PD patients increased significantly compared to ccfDNA, and ccf mtDNA decreased in PD patients more than it did in healthy controls. These decreases were not statistically significant but were in agreement with previous data. Interestingly, ccf mtDNA increased in healthy control patients in both serum and CSF as compared to ccfDNA. The small sample size of serum and CSF were the main limitations of this study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study on serum and CSF of PD patients using ddPCR to indicate the distribution of the copy number of ccf mtDNA as well as ccfDNA. If validated, we suggest that ccf mtDNA has greater potential than ccfDNA to lead the development of novel treatments for PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Effective screening modalities are currently available for only a small subset of cancers, and they generally have suboptimal performance with complicated procedures. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop simple, accurate, and non-invasive methods for early detection of cancers. Genetic and epigenetic alterations in plasma circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) have shown the potential to revolutionize methods of early detection of cancers and facilitate subsequent diagnosis to improve survival of patients. The medical interest in cfDNA assays has been inspired by emerging single-and multi-early detection of cancers studies. This review summarizes current technological and clinical advances, in the hopes of providing insights into the development and applications of cfDNA assays in various cancers and clinical scenarios. The key phases of clinical development of biomarkers are highlighted, and the future developments of cfDNA-based liquid biopsies in early detection of cancers are outlined. It is hoped that this study can boost the potential integration of cfDNA-based early detection of cancers into the current clinical workflow.",

    "abstract": "Cell-free DNA molecules are released into the plasma via apoptotic or necrotic events and active release mechanisms, which carry the genetic and epigenetic information of its origin tissues. However, cfDNA is the mixture of various cell fragments, and the efficient enrichment of cfDNA fragments with diagnostic value remains a great challenge for application in the clinical setting. Evidence from recent years shows that cfDNA fragmentomics' characteristics differ in normal and diseased individuals without the need to distinguish the source of the cfDNA fragments, which makes it a promising novel biomarker. Moreover, cfDNA fragmentomics can identify tissue origins by inferring epigenetic information. Thus, further insights into the fragmentomics of plasma cfDNA shed light on the origin and fragmentation mechanisms of cfDNA during physiological and pathological processes in diseases and enhance our ability to take the advantage of plasma cfDNA as a molecular diagnostic tool. In this review, we focus on the cfDNA fragment characteristics and its potential application, such as fragment length, end motifs, jagged ends, preferred end coordinates, as well as nucleosome footprints, open chromatin region, and gene expression inferred by the cfDNA fragmentation pattern across the genome. Furthermore, we summarize the methods for deducing the tissue of origin by cfDNA fragmentomics.",

    "abstract": "Background. Pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality, yet a causative pathogen is identified in a minority of cases. Plasma microbial cell-free DNA sequencing may improve diagnostic yield in immunocompromised patients with pneumonia.Methods. In this prospective, multicenter, observational study of immunocompromised adults undergoing bronchoscopy to establish a pneumonia etiology, plasma microbial cell-free DNA sequencing was compared to standardized usual care testing. Pneumonia etiology was adjudicated by a blinded independent committee. The primary outcome, additive diagnostic value, was assessed in the Per Protocol population (patients with complete testing results and no major protocol deviations) and defined as the percent of patients with an etiology of pneumonia exclusively identified by plasma microbial cell-free DNA sequencing. Clinical additive diagnostic value was assessed in the Per Protocol subgroup with negative usual care testing.Results. Of 257 patients, 173 met Per Protocol criteria. A pneumonia etiology was identified by usual care in 52/173 (30.1%), plasma microbial cell-free DNA sequencing in 49/173 (28.3%) and the combination of both in 73/173 (42.2%) patients. Plasma microbial cell-free DNA sequencing exclusively identified an etiology of pneumonia in 21/173 patients (additive diagnostic value 12.1%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 7.7% to 18.0%, P < .001). In the Per Protocol subgroup with negative usual care testing, plasma microbial cell-free DNA sequencing identified a pneumonia etiology in 21/121 patients (clinical additive diagnostic value 17.4%, 95% CI, 11.1% to 25.3%).Conclusions. Non-invasive plasma microbial cell-free DNA sequencing significantly increased diagnostic yield in immunocompromised patients with pneumonia undergoing bronchoscopy and extensive microbiologic and molecular testing.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLiquid biopsy based on cell-free DNA (cfDNA) analysis holds significant promise as a minimally invasive approach for the diagnosis, genotyping, and monitoring of solid malignancies. Human tumors release cfDNA in the bloodstream through a combination of events, including cell death, active and passive release. However, the precise mechanisms leading to cfDNA shedding remain to be characterized. Addressing this question in patients is confounded by several factors, such as tumor burden extent, anatomical and vasculature barriers, and release of nucleic acids from normal cells. In this work, we exploited cancer models to dissect basic mechanisms of DNA release.MethodsWe measured cell loss ratio, doubling time, and cfDNA release in the supernatant of a colorectal cancer (CRC) cell line collection (N = 76) representative of the molecular subtypes previously identified in cancer patients. Association analyses between quantitative parameters of cfDNA release, cell proliferation, and molecular features were evaluated. Functional experiments were performed to test the impact of modulating DNA methylation on cfDNA release.ResultsHigher levels of supernatant cfDNA were significantly associated with slower cell cycling and increased cell death. In addition, a higher cfDNA shedding was found in non-CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP) models. These results indicate a positive correlation between lower methylation and increased cfDNA levels. To explore this further, we exploited methylation microarrays to identify a subset of probes significantly associated with cfDNA shedding and derive a methylation signature capable of discriminating high from low cfDNA releasers. We applied this signature to an independent set of 176 CRC cell lines and patient derived organoids to select 14 models predicted to be low or high releasers. The methylation profile successfully predicted the amount of cfDNA released in the supernatant. At the functional level, genetic ablation of DNA methyl-transferases increased chromatin accessibility and DNA fragmentation, leading to increased cfDNA release in isogenic CRC cell lines. Furthermore, in vitro treatment of five low releaser CRC cells with a demethylating agent was able to induce a significant increase in cfDNA shedding.ConclusionsMethylation status of cancer cell lines contributes to the variability of cfDNA shedding in vitro. Changes in methylation pattern are associated with cfDNA release levels and might be exploited to increase sensitivity of liquid biopsy assays.",

    "abstract": "Rationale: Plasma cell-free DNA levels correlate with disease severity in many conditions. Pretransplant cell-free DNA may risk stratify lung transplant candidates for post-transplant complications. Objectives: To evaluate if pretransplant cell-free DNA levels and tissue sources identify patients at high risk of primary graft dysfunction and other pre- and post-transplant outcomes. Methods: This multicenter, prospective cohort study recruited 186 lung transplant candidates. Pretransplant plasma samples were collected to measure cell-free DNA. Bisulfite sequencing was performed to identify the tissue sources of cell-free DNA. Multivariable regression models determined the association between cell-free DNA levels and the primary outcome of primary graft dysfunction and other transplant outcomes, including Lung Allocation Score, chronic lung allograft dysfunction, and death. Measurements and Main Results: Transplant candidates had twofold greater cell-free DNA levels than healthy control patients (median [interquartile range], 23.7 ng/ml [15.1-35.6] vs. 12.9 ng/ml [9.9-18.4]; P < 0.0001), primarily originating from inflammatory innate immune cells. Cell-free DNA levels and tissue sources differed by native lung disease category and correlated with the Lung Allocation Score (P, 0.001). High pretransplant cell-free DNA increased the risk of primary graft dysfunction (odds ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-2.46; P = 0.0220), and death (hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.07-1.92; P = 0.0171) but not chronic lung allograft dysfunction (hazard ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.97-1.94; P = 0.0767). Conclusions: Lung transplant candidates demonstrate a heightened degree of tissue injury with elevated cell-free DNA, primarily originating from innate immune cells. Pretransplant plasma cell-free DNA levels predict post-transplant complications.",

    "abstract": "Background: Products of conception samples are often collected and analyzed to try to determine the cause of an early pregnancy loss. However, sample collection may not always be possible, and maternal cell contamination and culture failure can affect the analysis. Cell-free DNA-based analysis of a blood sample could be used as an alternative method in early pregnancy loss cases to detect if aneuploidies were present in the fetus. Methods: In this prospective study, blood samples from early pregnancy loss patients were analyzed for the presence of fetal aneuploidies using a modified version of a noninvasive prenatal testing assay for cell-free DNA analysis. Results from cell-free DNA analysis were compared against the gold standard, microarray analysis of products of conception samples. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT04935138. Results: Of the 76 patient samples included in the final study cohort, 11 were excluded from performance calculations. The 65 patient samples included in the final analysis included 49 with an abnormal microarray result and 16 with a normal microarray result. Based on results from these 65 samples, the study found that genome-wide cell-free DNA analysis had a sensitivity of 73.5% with a specificity of 100% for the detection of fetal aneuploidies in early pregnancy loss cases. Conclusions: This prospective study provides further support for the utility of cell-free DNA analysis in detecting fetal aneuploidies in early pregnancy loss cases. This approach could allow for a noninvasive method of investigating the etiology of miscarriages to be made available clinically.",

    "abstract": "Simple Summary Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) are pieces of DNA released from cells into body fluids. Previous studies in adult horses found that plasma cfDNA concentrations differed significantly between healthy horses and those with emergencies like colic. These studies also showed that accurate measurement of plasma cfDNA in adult horses required extraction, due to matrix effects of equine plasma. It's unclear if similar issues exist in foal plasma. In our study, we aimed to determine if foal plasma has similar interference, and if there are differences in cfDNA levels between healthy, sick non-septic (SNS), and septic foals. Cell-free DNA was measured directly in plasma and after extracting it using a kit in 60 foals. Direct measurement of cfDNA in foal plasma was found to be inaccurate due to matrix effect. However, even after cfDNA extraction, there were no significant differences in plasma cfDNA levels or the ratio of cfDNA to neutrophils between healthy foals, SNS foals, and septic foals. Future research should focus on understanding how neutrophils function during foal sepsis.Abstract Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is fragmented extracellular DNA that is released from cells into various body fluids. Previously published data from adult horses supports cfDNA as a potential disease biomarker, but also shows that direct measurement in plasma is inaccurate due to matrix effect. It is currently unknown whether a similar matrix effect exists in foal plasma. Given this, the objectives of the current study were to investigate foal plasma for potential matrix effect during fluorescence measurement of cfDNA using a Qubit fluorometer, and to determine whether neat and/or extracted plasma cfDNA concentrations are significantly different in healthy, sick non-septic (SNS) or septic foals. We hypothesized that matrix effect would interfere with accurate fluorescent measurement of cfDNA in foal plasma. Further, we hypothesized that mean extracted cfDNA concentrations, and/or extracted cfDNA:neutrophil ratio, would be elevated in plasma of septic foals compared to healthy or SNS foals. Cell-free DNA was measured in neat plasma, and following DNA extraction with a commercial kit, from 60 foals. Foal plasma exhibited both autofluorescence and non-specific dye binding, confirming matrix effect. However, even with extraction, no significant difference was found in cfDNA concentrations, or cfDNA:neutrophil ratios, between healthy (sepsis score <= 5), SNS (sepsis score 6-11 and negative blood culture), or septic (sepsis score >= 12 +/- positive blood culture) foals. Our data show that matrix effect interferes with accurate Qubit measurement of cfDNA in foal plasma and supports previous findings that plasma cfDNA concentrations are not associated with sepsis diagnosis in foals. Further research is needed to better understand neutrophil function and dysfunction in foal sepsis.",

However, numerous cancer studies have shown that cfDNA is informative about acquired resistance to given therapies, which is present in living, proliferating tumor subclones. To explain this contradiction, we review current insights regarding cfDNA release, in particular the interplay between apoptosis and proliferation.

In this study, we developed an improved strategy for detecting HBV DNA integration in plasma cfDNA, based on DNA probe capture and next-generation sequencing. Using this optimized strategy, we successfully detected HBV integration events in chimeric artificial DNA samples and HBV-infected HepG2-NTCP cells at day one post infection, with high sensitivity and accuracy. The characteristics of HBV integration events in the HBV-infected HepG2-NTCP cells and plasma cfDNA from HBV-infected individuals (CHB, LC, and HCC) were further investigated. A total of 112 and 333 integration breakpoints were detected in the HepG2-NTCP cells and 22 out of 25 (88%) clinical HBV-infected samples, respectively. In vivo analysis showed that the normalized number of support unique sequences (nnsus) in HCC was significantly higher than in CHB or LC patients (P values < 0.05). All integration breakpoints are randomly distributed on human chromosomes and are enriched in the HBV genome around nt 1800. The majority of integration breakpoints (61.86%) are located in the gene-coding region. Both non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) interactions occurred during HBV integration across the three different stages of liver diseases. Our study provides evidence that HBV DNA integration can be detected in the plasma cfDNA of HBV-infected patients, including those with CHB, LC, or HCC, using this optimized strategy.",

We aimed to characterize mtDNA methylation alterations in the plasma cfDNA of 31 AD patients and 26 age- and sex-matched cognitively normal control subjects. We found that the mtDNA methylation patterns differed between AD patients and control subjects. The mtDNA was predominantly hypomethylated in the plasma cfDNA of AD patients. The hypomethylation sites or regions were mainly located in mt-rRNA, mt-tRNA, and D-Loop regions. The hypomethylation of the D-Loop region in plasma cfDNA of AD patients was consistent with that in previous studies. This study presents evidence that hypomethylation in the non-protein coding region of mtDNA may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD and potential application for the diagnosis of AD.",

The study of the fragmentation patterns of cfDNA, also referred to as 'fragmentomics', is now an actively pursued area of biomarker research. Clues that cfDNA fragmentation patterns might carry information concerning the tissue of origin of cfDNA molecules have come from works demonstrating that circulating fetal, tumor-derived, and transplanted liver-derived cfDNA molecules have a shorter size distribution than the background mainly of hematopoietic origin. More recently, an improved understanding of cfDNA fragmentation has provided many emerging fragmentomic markers, including fragment sizes, preferred ends, end motifs, single-stranded jagged ends, and nucleosomal footprints. The intrinsic biological link between activities of various DNA nucleases and characteristic fragmentations has been demonstrated.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by memory loss and multiple cognitive impairments. AD is pathologically characterized by age-dependent accumulation of amyloid-beta protein and the phosphorylation of tau protein in the brains of patients with AD. Clinically, manifestations of AD include cognitive decline, dementia, alterations of high-order brain functions, and movement disorders. Double-stranded DNA breaks are a lethal form of DNA damage and are typically repaired via non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination. However, in AD brain, repair mechanism is disrupted, leading to a cascade of events, cognitive dysfunction, organ failure and reduced lifespan. Increased circulating cell-free DNA in the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine in patients with AD, can be used as early detectable biomarkers for AD. The purpose of our article is to explore the potential uses of cell-free DNA and double-stranded DNA breaks as prognostic markers for AD and examine the recent research on the application of these markers in studies.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: The spatially complex nature of mesothelioma and interventions like pleurodesis, surgery, and radiation often complicate imaging-based assessment. Further, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) based monitoring strategies are inadequate for mesothelioma, given the presence of a few recurring nonsynonymous somatic variants. However, patient-specific chromosomal rearrangements are commonly found in mesothelioma. Our study objective was to develop an individualized cfDNA assay to enable blood-based monitoring using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in mesothelioma. We hypothesized that the unique chromosomal rearrangement junctions found in mesothelioma could be employed for individualized ctDNA detection and disease monitoring. Methods: DNA was extracted from tumor specimens for whole genome sequencing. Chromosomal junctions, prioritized by highest allele frequency and low homology to the rest of the genome, were selected for detection. Primers and Taqman probes were designed to span the junctions, forming personalized junction panels. Patient plasma obtained before therapy and at response assessment was tested for the presence of personalized junctions via quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results: Our study included nine patients, four with peritoneal and five with pleural mesothelioma. 763 chromosomal junctions were identified in the tumors of all cases. We selected three to five junctions per sample for quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We detected 25/30 (83%) of selected junctions in the plasma of seven out of nine patients (78%). Cell-free junction detection at follow-up was concordant with disease status: cfDNA junctions were detected in three patients with persistent disease, and not detected in a patient with no evidence of disease after surgery. Conclusions: With further validation, individualized ctDNA junction assays could supplement imaging for disease monitoring in mesothelioma. (c) 2024 The Authors.
